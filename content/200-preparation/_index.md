### AWS CLI

The AWS CLI allows you to interact with AWS services from a terminal session.

- If you haven't installed AWS CLI, follow [the official guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) to install to latest version.

- After you installed AWS CLI, verify it works as expected.

  ```shell
  aws --version
  ```

  ```shell
  # Output
  aws-cli/2.27.22 Python/3.13.3 Linux/6.14.6-300.fc42.x86_64 exe/x86_64.fedora.42
  ```

### Configure AWS CLI with your AWS credentials

To interact with AWS, the AWS CLI needs your credentials.

- Follow [Authenticating using IAM user credentials for the AWS CLI - AWS Command Line Interface](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-authentication-user.html) to authenticate using IAM user credentials.

- After configure the AWS CLI, check the identity used by AWS CLI:

  ```shell
  aws sts get-caller-identity
  ```

  Output:

  ```json
  {
    "UserId": "AROA5OWSGDSIZREXGLG2K:thangfcj+devops@gmail.com",
    "Account": "924932512913",
    "Arn": "arn:aws:sts::924932512913:assumed-role/AWSReservedSSO_AdministratorAccess_6ce8cc3bd00b0421/thangfcj+devops@gmail.com"
  }
  ```

> [!TIP]
> By default, `aws sts get-caller-identity` use cli pager (e.g. `less`, `more`) for the output.
>
> - Press `q` to exit the pager.
> - Or use `--no-cli-pager` option to disable the cli pager.

### Node.js

The AWS CDK uses Node.js 18 or later.

- Follow [Download Node.jsÂ®](https://nodejs.org/en/download) to install Node.js

> [!NOTE]
> A version in active long-term support (LTS) (v22.x at this writing) is recommended.

- After install Node.js, verify it works:

  ```shell
  node --version
  ```

  ```shell
  # Output
  v22.16.0
  ```

### IDE for your programming language

One of the benefits of the AWS CDK is that you can leverage your favorite development environments and have a rich experience when exploring the hundreds of different services and features of AWS.

- You should use an IDE that supports _code-completion_ and _syntax highlighting_ for your language of choice.

  [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (VSCode) - a free, open-source IDE - is a good choice.

### AWS CDK Toolkit

The AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) Command Line Interface (AWS CDK CLI), also known as the CDK Toolkit, is the primary tool for interacting with your AWS CDK app.

- It executes your app, interrogates the application model you defined, and produces and deploys the AWS CloudFormation templates generated by the AWS CDK.
- It also provides other features useful for creating and working with AWS CDK projects.

AWS CDK CLI is published as a npm package.

- To install AWS CDK CLI, use `npm` - the package manager for Javascript library.

  ```shell
  npm install -g aws-cdk
  ```

  > [!NOTE]
  > The package manager `npm` comes with Node.js.

- Verify AWS CDK CLI works as expected.

  ```shell
  cdk --version
  ```

  ```shell
  # Output
  2.1016.1 (build 6de56b2)
  ```
