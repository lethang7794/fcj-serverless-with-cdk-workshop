### An IAM user with Administrator permission

You will need an IAM user with `AdministratorAccess` permissions that you can login with to AWS Management Console.

If you haven't create an IAM user, follow [Create IAM Group and IAM User :: MANAGING ACCESS CONTROL WITH AWS IAM (IDENTITY AND ACCESS MANAGEMENT)](https://000002.awsstudygroup.com/2-create-admin-user-and-group/) to create one.

### AWS CLI installed and configured with the credential for that IAM user

- Run `aws sts get-caller-identity` to verify it:

  Your output may looks a little bit different than mine.

- If you can't run `aws sts get-caller-identity`, follow [Install AWS CLI :: GETTING STARTED WITH THE AWS CLI](https://000011.awsstudygroup.com/3-installcli/).

### Node.js

The AWS CDK uses Node.js 18 or later.

- Follow [Download Node.jsÂ®](https://nodejs.org/en/download) to install Node.js

> [!NOTE]
> A version in active long-term support (LTS) (v22.x at this writing) is recommended.

- After install Node.js, verify it works:

  ```shell
  node --version
  ```

### IDE for your programming language

One of the benefits of the AWS CDK is that you can leverage your favorite development environments and have a rich experience when exploring the hundreds of different services and features of AWS.

- You should use an IDE that supports _code-completion_ and _syntax highlighting_ for your language of choice.

  [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (VSCode) - a free, open-source IDE - is a good choice.

### AWS CDK Toolkit

The AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) Command Line Interface (AWS CDK CLI), also known as the CDK Toolkit, is the primary tool for interacting with your AWS CDK app.

- It executes your app, interrogates the application model you defined, and produces and deploys the AWS CloudFormation templates generated by the AWS CDK.
- It also provides other features useful for creating and working with AWS CDK projects.

AWS CDK CLI is published as a npm package.

- To install AWS CDK CLI, use `npm` - the package manager for JavaScript library.

  ```shell
  npm install -g aws-cdk
  ```

  > [!NOTE]
  > The package manager `npm` comes with Node.js.

- Verify AWS CDK CLI works as expected.

  ```shell
  cdk --version
  ```
